# STM32F401RE_Nucleo_Board
This repository includes embedded driver for several peripherals (and their applications GPIO's, SPI, I2C, UART, ...) which needed for using STM32F401RE Nucleo Board. This repository is created with the supports of MCU1 course from the Fastbit Brain Academy.

You can apply this drivers directly your STM32F401RE board with STM32CubeIDE.
